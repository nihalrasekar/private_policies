# Privacy Policy for EggTimer

**Last updated: February 26, 2026**

EggTimer ("we", "us", or "our") operates the EggTimer mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information through our App.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Personal Data
We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or location.

### Usage Data
The App is designed to function entirely on your device. We do not track your usage patterns or collect analytics data.

## 2. Device Permissions

To provide its core functionality, the App may request or use the following device features:

- **Audio/Notifications:** Used to play an alert sound and notify you when your egg timer has completed.
- **Haptics:** Used to provide tactile feedback during timer operations.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The App is standalone and does not integrate with any third-party data-sharing services. 
- **Audio Assets:** The App loads a notification sound from a remote URL (Mixkit). This request may involve standard web logging by the host (like your IP address), but no personal data from the App is shared.

## 4. Data Security

Since no personal data is collected or stored by the App, there is no risk of your personal information being compromised through our systems.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Our App does not collect any information from children, as it does not collect any information at all.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy.
